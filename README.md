<h1 align="center">CORONA: COVID-19</h1>
A desktop tray application based on Electron and VueJS to stay up to date with the latest Corona: COVID-19 virus information.

## Why?
Coronavirus isn't just a regular flu that will simply go away. It is 2020, the modern tech world and we are still struggling to protect our family against this.

As soon as I saw the [COVID-19 API](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api), I have decided to make something simple. This will not only help people to get the information but will also help me to learn new technologies.

## Interface
It's not that much but wanted to make something simple and lightweight using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Features
I have always wanted to keep the app simple to make sure it loads faster (as we all know Electron is a resource heavy technology) but still get the most out of the data.

 - Total deaths
 - Total reported case
 - Total confirmed case
 - Sum of total reported case
 - Latest global confirmed case
 - Latest global recovered case
 - Automatic current country detection
 - Switch between countries to see the total affected numbers
 - Offline support when internet connection isn't available
 - Auto launch on system reboot
 - Refresh the data to get the most recent update

## Caution

The source codes are bit of nasty and there's no unit test for the app as I wanted to make something very quickly. So, there's a lot of places for improvements. So, if you do look at the source code, please do feel free to send a pull request :)
